# What it is for?
**The text of SVG images that are made in Excalidraw after version 1.9.1 is not displayed correctly
I saved this version of the plugin for Obsidian so I don't have to wait for the current version to be fixed**

# How it works?
**If you want to use this version of Excalidraw in your Obsidian Vault, you must move the contents of the "source" folder to the following path:
*your vault folder*/.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin/**
